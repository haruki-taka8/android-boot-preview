# android-boot-preview
<br><br>
A Powershell/WPF program for viewing Android bootanimation.zip

I am developing this program because it is time-consuming to manually update `/system/media` and check out how boot animations look, and also because there are only few desktop-based previewers.

## Operation Mode
**1. WPF Mode**\
  Run `ABP-GUI.ps1`

**2. CLI Mode**\
  Pass `InPath`, `ScreenW`, `ScreenH`, `BootTime`, and `Repeat` to `ABP-CLI.ps1`

Downloading FFMPEG is a pain; avoiding its Hall of Shame is a bigger one. So please download it yourself. Good luck.
